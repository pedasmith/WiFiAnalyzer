Definitions of words and acronyms commonly used in Wi-Fi networking

|Word|Meaning|
|-----|-----|
|**802.11**|The numeric name for the IEEE (Institute for Electrical Engineering) standards that define Wi-Fi. There are many sub-standards.
|**Access Point**|A Wi-Fi *access point* is usually a small, standalone 'box' with stubby radio antenaes. The access point is what provides the Wi-Fi service. Each access point generally requires a connection to the internet to provide internet connectivity; without such a connection it merely provide LAN access.
|**AP**|Access Point
|**Band**|Wi-Fi supports several different *bands* (like *2.4 GigaHerz*). Each band is divided into multiple channels.
|**Channel**|Each Wi-Fi *band* is divided into *channels*. Each channel has a number which is related to it's overall frequency. The names are not unique; for example, both the 2.4 GHz and 5 Ghz bands have a channel number 7. The channels will overlap: transmitting on a 2.4 GHz channel will spill over and interfere with the surrounding channels. Transmitting on a 20 MHz channel in the 5 GHz band will not interfere with any other 20 MHz channel.
|**GHz**|Giga-hertz; 1 thousand-million *hertz* or cycles per second. Wi-Fi bands are listed by their overall GHz value. For example, Wi-Fi bands include the 6 GHz, 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands.
|**LAN**|Local Area Network. Usually each house or store or hotel will make a local area network that is connected via a router to the internet. Devices on a local network can connect to each other (e.g., a laptop can connect to a local printer).
|**MHz**|Mega-hertz; 1 million *hertz* or cycles per second. Channel bandwidth is listed in MHz. More MHz means more data can be transmitted.
|**RADAR**|Originally an acronym for Radio Direction and Ranging (distance), RADAR is commonly used to mean any kind of circular display with data points placed on it.
|**Wi-Fi**|A popular wireless network standard. Other names includes  *802.11* and *WLAN*. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)
|**WLAN**|Wireless LAN (Local Area Network) is a generic term to describe many different radio standards for network connections. Wi-Fi is the most popular of the wireless standards.
